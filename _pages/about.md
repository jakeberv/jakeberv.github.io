*My research integrates data from natural history, ecology, genomics, and paleontology---often through the application of novel computation tools---in order to understand the links between micro- and macroevolution.*

I have studied groups of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and deep-sea invertebrates. [Go Directly to Research](https://www.jakeberv.com/research){: .btn--research}

Since November, 2019, I have been a [Life Sciences Fellow](https://lifescifellows.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I am affiliated with the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/jacob-berv.html), [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth/research/paleontology.html), and the [University of Michigan Museum of Zoology](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummz).

In February 2023, I was awarded an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://midas.umich.edu/ai-in-science/) to further develop my interdisciplinary [research program](https://www.jakeberv.com/research).

Previously, I:

-   earned a PhD at Cornell University (2013-2019), working within [Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). As a graduate student, I investigated several [dimensions of biodiversity](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0944ba11c7dc9bdbfd11748cb2de4cfa/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), applying the tools of Systematic Biology, Population Genomics, and Paleontology.

-   worked as a researcher in the [Prum Lab](https://prumlab.yale.edu/) (2010-2013), where I largely focused on discovering the evolutionary relationships [within](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032100138X) and [among](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697) bird species.

-   completed a Bachelors of Science degree at [Yale University](https://eeb.yale.edu/) (2006-2010). My senior thesis investigated patterns of phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed open-habitat specialists [across the Amazon basin](https://jakeberv.github.io/publication/2021-03-08-vanEls_et_al_2021).

#### The site's banner is a portion of Salvador Dali's "Persistence of Memory." Dawn Adès wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order." In evolutionary biology, time is often relative and (outside of paleontology) rarely absolute. Dalí's olive tree with its cut branches, overlain by time, is a reminder of the challenges we face in understanding the tree of life.
