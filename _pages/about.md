*My research integrates data from natural history, ecology, genomics, and paleontology---often through the application of novel computation tools---in order to understand the links between micro- and macroevolution. A need to decipher whole genomes, range maps for thousands of species, eons of ecological and climate information, in the context of millions of preserved museum specimens has created new imperatives for the training of researchers in the life sciences. Integrating these data types to answer questions about biological processes and how they have shaped our world is an emerging "grand challenge" in biodiversity science.*

Since November, 2019, I have been a [Life Sciences Fellow](https://lifescifellows.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I am affiliated with the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/jacob-berv.html), [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth/research/paleontology.html), and the [University of Michigan Museum of Zoology](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummz).

In February 2023, I was awarded an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://midas.umich.edu/ai-in-science/) to further develop an interdisciplinary [research program](jakeberv.com/research).

Previously, I:

-   earned a PhD at Cornell University (2013-2019), working within [Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). As a graduate student, I investigated several [dimensions of biodiversity](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0944ba11c7dc9bdbfd11748cb2de4cfa/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), applying the tools of Systematic Biology, Population Genomics, and Paleontology.

-   worked as a researcher in the [Prum Lab](https://prumlab.yale.edu/) (2010-2013), where I largely focused on discovering the evolutionary relationships [within](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032100138X) and [among](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697) bird species.

-   completed a Bachelors of Science degree at [Yale University](https://eeb.yale.edu/) (2006-2010). My senior thesis investigated patterns of phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed open-habitat specialists [across the Amazon basin](https://jakeberv.github.io/publication/2021-03-08-vanEls_et_al_2021).

#### *The site's banner is a portion of Salvador Dali's "Persistence of Memory." Dawn Adès wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order." In evolutionary biology, time is often relative and (outside of paleontology) rarely absolute. Dalí's olive tree with its cut branches, overlain by time, is a reminder of the challenges we face in understanding the tree of life.*
