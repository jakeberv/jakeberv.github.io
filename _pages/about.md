# About me

*My research program integrates data from natural history, ecology, genomics, and paleontology---often through the application of novel computation tools---in order to understand the links between micro- and macroevolution.* 

[Go Directly to Research](https://www.jakeberv.com/research){: .btn--research} for examples considering groups of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and deep-sea invertebrates.

I am currently supported by an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://midas.umich.edu/news/michigan-institute-for-data-science-announces-new-fellows/).

<b>Previously, I:</b>

-   was a [Life Sciences Fellow](https://lifescifellows.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan (2019-2023).

-   earned a PhD at Cornell University (2013-2019), working within [Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). As a graduate student, I investigated several [dimensions of biodiversity](https://jakeberv.com/publication/2019-08-30-Berv_2019), applying the tools of Systematic Biology, Population Genomics, and Paleontology.

-   worked as a researcher in the [Prum Lab](https://prumlab.yale.edu/) (2010-2013), where I largely focused on discovering the evolutionary relationships [within](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032100138X) and [among](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697) bird species.

-   completed a Bachelors of Science degree at [Yale University](https://eeb.yale.edu/) (2006-2010). My senior thesis investigated patterns of phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed open-habitat specialists [across the Amazon basin](https://jakeberv.github.io/publication/2021-03-08-vanEls_et_al_2021).

<b>I am currently affiliated with five groups within the University of Michigan</b>
1. [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/jacob-berv.html)
2. [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth/research/paleontology.html)
3. [Museum of Zoology](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummz) 
4. [Institute for Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/)

#### The site's banner is a portion of Salvador Dali's "Persistence of Memory." Dawn Adès wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order." In evolutionary biology, time is often relative and (outside of paleontology) rarely absolute. Dalí's olive tree with its cut branches, overlain by time, is a reminder of the challenges we face in understanding the tree of life. To the top left, an allusion to Charles Darwin's note, "I think", from his famous [illustration of a phylogenetic tree](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/the-idea-takes-shape/i-think).
