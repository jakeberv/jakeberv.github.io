*My research integrates data from natural history, ecology, genomics, and paleontology---often through the application of novel computation tools---in order to understand the links between micro- and macroevolution.*

Since November, 2019, I have been a [Life Sciences Fellow](https://lifescifellows.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I am affiliated with the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/jacob-berv.html), Earth and Environmental Sciences, and the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.

Previously, I:

-   earned a PhD at Cornell University (2013-2019), working within [Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). As a graduate student, I investigated several [dimensions of biodiversity](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0944ba11c7dc9bdbfd11748cb2de4cfa/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), applying the tools of Systematic Biology, Population Genomics, and Paleontology.

-   worked as a researcher in the [Prum Lab](https://prumlab.yale.edu/) (2010-2013), where I largely focused on discovering the evolutionary relationships [within](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032100138X) and [among](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697) bird species.

-   completed a Bachelors of Science degree at [Yale University](https://eeb.yale.edu/) (2006-2010). My senior thesis investigated patterns of phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed open-habitat specialists across the Amazon basin.
