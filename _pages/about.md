*I consider information from natural history, ecology, genomics, and paleontology---often through the application of novel computation tools---in order to understand the links between micro- and macroevolution*

Since in November, 2019, I have been a [Life Sciences Fellow](https://lifescifellows.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I am affiliated with the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Earth and Environmental Sciences, and the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/jacob-berv.html).

Previously, I:

-   earned a PhD at Cornell University (2013-2019), working within [Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). As a graduate student, I investigated several [dimensions of biodiversity](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0944ba11c7dc9bdbfd11748cb2de4cfa/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), applying the tools of Systematic Biology, Population Genomics, and Paleontology

-   worked as a researcher in the [Prum Lab](https://prumlab.yale.edu/) (2010-2013), where I largely focused on discovering the evolutionary relationships [within](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032100138X) and [among](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697) bird species.

-   completed a Bachelors of Science degree at [Yale University](https://eeb.yale.edu/) (2006-2010). My senior thesis investigated patterns of phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed open-habitat specialists across the Amazon basin.

## Research Interests

In brief, my research is driven by various links between micro and macroevolution, often through a lens of molecular evolution and systematic biology. I am most fascinated by how microevolutionary genetic processes operating at the level of individual organisms and populations may propagate through the tree of life and time to generate macroevolutionary patterns. Accordingly, my research program integrates across evolutionary scales, from the genome to higher taxa. While much of my experience has centered on birds, my approach is taxonomically inclusive, and I have also investigated groups of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and  deep-sea invertebrates. Some of the questions guiding my research include: What are the roles of evolutionary contingency and convergence in generating patterns of biodiversity? When and why might one of these modes of evolution predominate over the other? What are the drivers and correlates of evolutionary change?
