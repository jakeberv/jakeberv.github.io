<b>Previously, I:</b>

-   was a [Life Sciences Fellow](https://lifescifellows.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan (2019-2023).

-   earned a PhD at Cornell University (2013-2019), working within [Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/). As a graduate student, I investigated several [dimensions of biodiversity](https://jakeberv.com/publication/2019-08-30-Berv_2019), applying the tools of Systematic Biology, Population Genomics, and Paleontology. [Key Paper 1](https://jakeberv.com/publication/2018-01-01-Berv_Field_2018){: .btn--research}[Publisher's Award](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/pages/publishers_award?login=false#:~:text=Genomic%20Signature%20of,Berv%20et%20al.){: .btn--research}[Key Paper 2](https://github.com/jakeberv/jakeberv.github.io/raw/master/files/pdf/papers/Berv_et_al_2021.pdf){: .btn--research}[2019 Defense Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A-j2DccpTw&list=PLt6TWRNEKcmUMXvUPbpFPVvb7Z8d0UbaN){: .btn--research}

-   worked as a researcher in the [Prum Lab](https://prumlab.yale.edu/) (2010-2013), where I largely focused on discovering the evolutionary relationships [within](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032100138X) and [among](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697) bird species.

-   completed a Bachelors of Science degree at [Yale University](https://eeb.yale.edu/) (2006-2010). My senior thesis investigated patterns of phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed open-habitat specialists [across the Amazon basin](https://jakeberv.github.io/publication/2021-03-08-vanEls_et_al_2021).
