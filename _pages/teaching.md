I am an evolutionary biologist, and I care about teaching evolution because, as noted by Dobzhansky, "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." Though I wish all my students would follow me deciphering the rules of life, my job as a science educator is first to provide access to scientific literacy. Literacy in evolutionary biology has never been more important. Evolutionary processes shape every facet of the natural world, and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how evolution impacts our daily lives [Indeed, the story of how phylogenetics routinely saves us from dire epidemiological events is not told often enough]. More generally, a limited understanding of evolution can impede a person's ability to make informed decisions on important issues. As discussed by Brandt et al. 2022, scientific literacy encompasses four key learning goals: content knowledge, procedural knowledge, epistemic knowledge, and application of knowledge. These axes are critical in understanding and evaluating the evidence for evolutionary processes, as well as in applying evolutionary concepts to real-world situations.

    -   I designed semester long seminar courses with guidance from the John. S. Knight Institute for Writing in the Disciplines. My course offered undergraduates an opportunity to engage with and learn to write about primary scientific literature in a variety of formats. Student evaluations available.
