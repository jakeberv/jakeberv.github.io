        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "I maintain research software focused on evolutionary biology and systematics, including tools for phylogenetic inference, macroevolutionary modeling, comparative methods, data wrangling for large genomic and trait datasets, and reproducible workflows for figure generation and manuscript pipelines."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "All active projects are linked from the Software page and hosted on GitHub under the jakeberv organization or my user account. Stable releases are available on GitHub Releases; some R or Python packages may also be available on CRAN, PyPI, or conda-forge as noted in each project’s README."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Installation instructions are provided per project. For R packages, install via install.packages() if on CRAN or remotes::install_github(\"owner/repo\"). For Python, use pip install package-name or conda install -c conda-forge package-name. Command-line tools distribute prebuilt binaries for macOS/Linux when possible; otherwise build from source following the README."
