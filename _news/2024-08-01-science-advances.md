  <p style="font-size: 0.85em; margin: 0; flex-grow: 1; align-self: flex-start; text-align: left;">This primary project from Jacob Berv's first postdoctoral appointment was published as the cover article in <em>Science Advances</em>. The study examines how bird genomes evolved after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction 66 million years ago. By analyzing multiple genomic regions, Berv and co-authors identified key sequence shifts linked to changes in development, body size, and metabolism. These findings suggest the mass extinction played a central role in shaping the early diversification of modern birds.</p>
