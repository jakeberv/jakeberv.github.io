Invited Pardee keynote at GSA 2025 on impact cratering and macroevolutionary recovery (DOI: 10.1130/abs/2025AM-11105).

The Geological Society of America Pardee Symposium highlights major scientific advances and research frontiers. In 2025, Jacob Berv was invited to give a keynote lecture exploring how impact cratering events have influenced macroevolutionary processes and life's recovery through deep time. The talk, titled <em>"Impact Cratering and the Evolution of Life"</em>, was part of the Pardee Symposium at the GSA Annual Meeting in San Antonio, TX.

<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
The keynote introduced a "phylogenetic natural history" framework that combines hypothesis-driven comparative inference with large genomic and paleontological datasets. It focused on the end-Cretaceous (K–Pg) mass extinction and evidence that coordinated shifts in avian body size, development, and genome evolution accompanied early post-extinction diversification. Together, these results link deep-time environmental contingencies to long-term patterns of evolutionary innovation and resilience.
