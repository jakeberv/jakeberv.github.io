  description: "Jake presents a high-throughput computer vision pipeline for digitizing avian skeletal morphology. He introduces 'Bifrost,' a multivariate phylogenetic comparative method designed to handle high-dimensional data without ordination. The talk demonstrates how these methods identify rate shifts in passerine evolution that correlate with major Cenozoic climate events."

  description: "Berv explores the 'Phylogenetic Natural History' framework, integrating genomics and paleontology to study the K-Pg mass extinction. He presents evidence for a genomic 'early burst' in birds, where shifts in substitution rates and base composition align with the 'Lilliput Effect' and transitions in metabolic allometry following the Chicxulub impact."

- title: "Molecular Early Burst associted with the Diversification of birds at the K-Pg boundary"
  youtube_id: "tAECFiSZR74"
  description: "In this invited seminar, Jake presents research addressing the 'rocks versus clocks' conflict in avian evolutionary history. He discusses how complex patterns of genome evolution—specifically a 'molecular early burst' associated with the K-Pg mass extinction—can distort traditional molecular clock estimates. The talk highlights how accounting for this genomic heterogeneity can reconcile fossil and molecular data, supporting a rapid radiation of modern birds following the extinction event."

  youtube_id: "JJ2HKO1Z_CM"
  description: "Presented at the University of Michigan EEB Tuesday Lunch Seminar, this talk investigates how the K-Pg mass extinction structured the evolutionary potential of modern birds. Jake details a novel analytical framework that identifies 'molecular early bursts'—heterogeneous shifts in nucleotide substitution rates—across exons, introns, and mitochondrial genomes. The presentation demonstrates how these genomic shifts correlate with macroevolutionary changes in body mass and metabolic allometry, providing evidence that the extinction event triggered integrated patterns of evolution across avian physiology and life history."
