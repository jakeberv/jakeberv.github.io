- title: "Tempo and Mode: Applying Phyogenetic Natural History to Integrate Micro- and Macrovolution"
  youtube_id: "IUKL0_gL8xs"
  description: "In this talk, I present research which applies concepts from 'Phylogenetic Natural History' to examine macroevolutionary patterns, integrating across different scientific disciplines. I concentrate on the effects of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction on genome evolution, using data science methods to understand evolutionary changes in surviving species. Specifically, I investigate how shifts in bird development, size, and metabolism correspond to genomic evolution, providing insights into the broader impacts of the end-Cretaceous transition on biodiversity."
