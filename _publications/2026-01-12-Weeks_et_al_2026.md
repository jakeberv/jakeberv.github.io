abstract: |
  This study asks how much temporal sampling is needed to reliably recover long-term morphological trends linked to climate change. Using long-term datasets for birds and mammals, the authors estimate minimum sampling durations needed to recover trait trends with high accuracy.

  The analyses indicate different thresholds among traits and groups (generally shorter for birds, longer for mammals), and then use those thresholds to map where museum collections can support robust global reconstructions. Opportunities are substantial but geographically uneven, with dense coverage concentrated in the United States and Europe.

**Abstract:** This study asks how much temporal sampling is needed to reliably recover long-term morphological trends linked to climate change.
