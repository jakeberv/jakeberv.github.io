**Abstract:** The study quantifies how the mandibular symphysis (the midline joint of the lower jaw) varies across 206 extant and fossil cetacean taxa, using phylogenetic comparative methods. Results indicate that ancestral whales likely had a fused, moderately elongated symphysis, with major shifts in fusion and length tracking oceanic changes and feeding innovations—peaking around the middle–late Eocene and the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Mysticetes evolved highly mobile, unfused mandibles, while several odontocete lineages later converged on fully fused, elongated jaws in the Miocene; ecological traits like feeding strategy, dentition, and prey type correlate strongly with these morphological patterns.
