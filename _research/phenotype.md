  <h2>Phenotype at a Glance: Key Findings</h2>

  <p>Across linked projects, the strongest recurring pattern is that complex phenotypes evolve through interacting shifts in behavior, morphology, and population history, not through single-trait change alone.</p>

  <ul class="phenotype-keypoints">
    <li><strong>Cotingas:</strong> A six-locus phylogeny spanning <strong>61 species across all 25 genera</strong> (~7,500 bp) resolved key relationships and found no broad-scale support for a simple polygyny-driven model of sexual dichromatism.</li>
    <li><strong>Bee hummingbirds:</strong> A <strong>35-species</strong> analysis detected multiple abrupt shifts in acoustic mechanisms (at least six major saltational changes), negative phylogenetic association between wing trills and singing, and repeated losses of learned song.</li>
    <li><strong>White-crowned manakin complex:</strong> Integrated genomic and phenotypic data support deep structure across the Neotropics, including <strong>14 vocalization types</strong> and evidence for <strong>at least 8</strong> diagnosable lineages, with potential diversity as high as 15–17 species.</li>

      <p>To examine the evolution of a behavioral secondary sexual trait, I studied vocal diversification in a cryptic species complex across the Amazon basin.

      <p>Our genomic phylogeography supports an Andean-origin scenario with subsequent lowland diversification and identifies substantial introgression among some western Amazonian populations.

  <h2>Fossil Reconstructions</h2>

  <h3>Estimating Body Mass</h3>
  <p>I am interested in how well we can reconstruct living characteristics from skeletal proportions, especially for taxa known only from fossils. Here, I use <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082000">allometric scaling equations</a> to estimate body-mass distributions for stem-lineage birds in the latest Maastrichtian.</p>
  <p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syx064">Berv and Field 2018 (<em>Systematic Biology</em>)</a>, we link these reconstruction efforts to molecular-rate dynamics across the avian tree. That study found strong associations between life-history traits and substitution-rate variation, with consequences for divergence-time inference near the K-Pg boundary.</p>

  <ul class="phenotype-keypoints">
    <li>Across birds, estimated genomic rates show pronounced heterogeneity (up to about 20-fold).</li>
    <li>Substitution rate is strongly associated with body size and metabolic rate in comparative analyses.</li>
    <li>Simulation results indicate life-history-associated rate differences can produce large shifts in inferred clade ages (on the order of tens of millions of years; approximately 37.5 Ma in one neornithine comparison).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fish Shape Evolution Across the Phanerozoic</h2>

  <p>In a recent preprint, Rivero-Vega et al. compare three canonical "living fossil" fish lineages—coelacanths, lungfishes, and holosteans—under a common analytical framework for both discrete characters and body-shape evolution.</p>

  <ul class="phenotype-keypoints">
    <li>Lungfishes show highest discrete-character rates early (especially around the Devonian), followed by long-term decline.</li>
    <li>Coelacanths show multiple early peaks and strong evidence of declining rates toward the recent.</li>
    <li>Holosteans show modest peaks but broadly more stable rates through time, with mixed support for sustained decline in body-shape rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The core takeaway is that "living fossil" lineages do not share a single evolutionary mode: tempo and mode vary among clades and by data type, reinforcing the need for explicit quantitative tests rather than qualitative labels.</p>
